Interstitiona Cytisis

terating now vs 
not treating now but possibly treating later

==================================================

Three quantities were measured repeatedly over time: 
	pain
		(subjective appraisal, 0-9, 9 being higher intensity)
	urgency
		(subjective appraisal, 0-9, 9 being higher intensity)
	nocturnal frequency of voiding

note: 
	baseline 
		value is the value of the variable before treatment
		when they first enter the study
		Tp and patient attributes at Tp
			is the attributes of the patients when one enters the treatment

	quantile is a breakpoint that divides a group
		the one half quantile divides a group into to parts
		in the study, the one-third quantile and the two-thirds quantile divides the group into 3 parts
			the one-third quantile divides the lower-one-third and the middle-one-third groups
			the two-thirds quantile divides the middle-one-third and the upper-one-third groups

	box/wisker plots
		we divide the data set into 4 parts using 3 quartiles
			[Q2] being the median of the entire datset
				splitting the data set into 2 parts

			[Q1] being the median of the lower half of the dataset
			[Q3] being the median of the upper half of the data set

		box
			[Q3], top of box is the upper quartile
			[Q2], line in the box is the middle quartile
			[Q1], bottom of the box is the lower quartile

		outliers/inlier
			inter quartile range (IQR) = [Q3] - [Q1]
			inlier range = ([Q1]-(1.5*[IQR]), [Q3]+(1.5*[IQR]))
		
		wiskers
			top wisker = max value of the dataset within the inlier range
			bottom wisker = min value of the dataset within the inlier range
			outliers are indicated by a dot on the graph "outside" the wiskers

==================================================

T	: time 
s	: pair of similar  patients
	non overlapping samples
	treated patient in pair s recieved treatment at Ts
	the control patient, s, 
		hasnt recieved the treatment yet 
		or recieved it after Ts
		but must be at risk of treatment at time Ts

their pairing algorithm
	nonoverlapping samples
	conditional distribution rather than partial likelihood
	match only on past data 
		never on future data

==================================================

A	: set of all patients
	consisting of {a1, a2, a3, ...}
T	: set of all treated patients
	consisting of {t1, t2, t3, ...}
	[T] is a subset of [A]
E	: edge connecting a pair of patients, [s]
	consisting of {e1, e2, e3, ...}
	is a subset of the direct product of [T] and [A]
M	: pair of matched people using the pairing algorithm
	consisting of {m1, m2, m3, ...}
	is a subet of E
	each [m] consists of subject [ap] and [aq]
	every pair of [ap], and [aq] exists in [M]

Pair matching is optimal of size if
	minimizes total distance within pairs
	Mahalanobis distance
		between subject ap and subject aq
		see section 3.1 last paragraph
	in this study |M| = S = 100 was picked

==================================================

Time is measured in 3 month intervals
	if m = (aq, ap)
	where 
		[ap] was treated at time [Tp]
		[aq] was untreated at time [Tp]
		[aq] was untreated until at least [Tp]+3 months

==================================================

K	: a set of binary variables for every [a]
	consisiting of {[Bp1], [Bp2], [Bp3], ...} 
	value is boolean
	each variable is a [Bpk] associated with patient attribute; ex:
		[Bpk] may describe gender of the [p]th treated subject
		[Bpk] may describe a time-varying attribute at time [ap]
	for each potential patient pairing ([ap], [aq])
		there are K binary variales
		there is a set of K binary varibles
	implicatoins
		for every pairing ([ap], [aq])
		patient [ap] recieved treatment
		patient [aq] did not
		[Bek] describes the potential pairing
			[Bpk] describes the treated patient [ap]
			[Bqk] describes the treated patient [aq]

==================================================

plots
	3 figures
	6 pairs of blox plots each 
		2 pairs for covariates before treatment
		4 pairs descirbing outcomes after the treatment
		>
			the plots describe the 
			outcome 3 and 6 months after treatment, and the 
			change in outcome from treatment to 3 or 6 months after treatment
